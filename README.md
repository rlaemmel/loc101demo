# Headline 

An illustrative examination of 101repo

# Motivation

Let us examine 101repo to determine how the LOC metric ("lines of code") compares for Java and Haskell. To this end, we determine LOC for all Java and Haskell files in the 101repo, and then we compute the median for LOC for both file types.

# Features

* [Software metrics demo](http://101companies.org/index.php/101feature:Software_metrics_demo)

# Usage

Run "make" while assiging the directory path for the 101contributions to variable "root".

Depending on directory locations, the invocation of "make" may take the following form:

<pre>
make root=../../101repo/contributions
</pre>
