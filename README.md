# Headline 

A trivial reverse engineering experiment

# Motivation

Let us perform a trivial analysis on the 101repo to illustrate some form of reverse engineering. That is, suppose we want to know how the Lines-Of-Code metrics (LOC) compare for Java and Haskell. We can easily determine LOC for all Java and Haskell files in the 101repo. As a result, we show the medians for the LOC metrics for Java and Haskell.

# Features

* [http://101companies.org/index.php/101feature:Software_metrics_demo Software metrics demo]

# Usage

Run "make" while assiging the directory path for the 101contributions to variable "root".

Depending on the location of directory, the invocation of "make" may take the following form:

<pre>
make root=../../101repo/contributions
</pre>
