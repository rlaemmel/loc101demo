# Headline 

An illustrative examination of 101repo

# Motivation

Let us examine 101repo to determine how the LOC metric ("lines of code") compares for Java and Haskell. To this end, we determine LOC for all Java and Haskell files in the 101repo, and then we look at min, max, and median for LOC for both types of files.

# Features

* [Software metrics demo](http://101companies.org/index.php/101feature:Software_metrics_demo)

# Usage

Place the directory for loc101demo _next_ to 101repo; otherwise the Makefile needs adjustment.

Have a look at "Makefile" or perhaps just run "make". 

See the numbers of files and LOC-related numbers as they are sent to stdout.
